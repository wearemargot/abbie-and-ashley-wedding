                    <p>We also love to get a coffee from Vinnie at his coffee stand, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coffee_synthesis/">Coffee Synthesis</a>, near the entrance to CitiPark and take a walk down the river.</p>
                    <p>For the best baked goods around, <a href="https://novabakehouse.com">NOVA Bakehouse</a> is a must. We love to share their cinammon buns, cardamon buns, morning buns and something unique to them - morning cakes.</p>
